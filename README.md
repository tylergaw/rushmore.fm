There used to be a great little music community here. Maybe there will be again.

## The Story
Rushmore was an excellent music site with an incredible community. You can read a bit about what it was in the 2013 Techcrunch article ["Rushmore.fm Wants To Fix The Music Industry"](https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/14/rushmore-fm/).

At some point it changed hands from the original creators. The new hands were not good. They were grade-A assholes. They abondoned the music concept of the site with no warning to the original community that made it an early success. They offered no data export. They didn't answer emails. Again, huge assholes of biblical proportion.

One night in 2017 I just happend to check the domain. That's something I do from time to time for sites I've spent a lot of time, but have then gone away. It's like Googling an Ex, don't judge. This 2017 night though, the domain didn't resolve. They'd let it slip. So I bought it.

I don't know if I'll ever do anything with it, but knowing that I have the domain and it's on auto-renew every year for $99 gives me some vindication.
